Hello everyone!! Feel free to use the code and customize at your own liking. Maybe improve the code and make it more like the actual device. The goal was to create a replica of the device basically to enjoy it on my phone just for personal use. There is no plan to publish anywhere else but here for hobby purposes. If anyone can modify the code and make it even better, I would love to see the finished product. I would spend more time if I wasn't so busy. I feel like this is the best place to leave this at for further improvements. Credits to user GenericUsernamemon over on https://withthewill.net/threads/digimon-v-pet-fangame-for-pc-alpha.18418/page-23  the rest of the images for the device are here: https://imgur.com/a/dvpet-colorized-mod-wip-87cPMxe   I will be working on it as well just curious how far it can go and how better it can get. With that being said, have a great one and thanks for your time.
